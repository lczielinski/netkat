# Mechanizing NetKAT Completeness (WIP)

## Environment setup
- This project compiles with Coq 8.19.2 and OCaml 5.2.0. We recommend setting up a fresh Opam switch with these versions, and use the [coq-lsp](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-lsp) VS Code extension (instead of VSCoq). 
- To compile, run `make clean`, then `make`, then `make install` (and restart the Coq LSP server if needed).
